# Intro-to-Machine-Intelligence
Introductory course covering the landscape of Machine Learning

### Course Description
Learn the basics of machine learning and how to apply predictive models with intutive and interactive tutorial lessons using jupyter notebooks!

### Prerequistes
- [Python Programing](https://www.python.org/)
- [Statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)
- [Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
- [Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab)

### Install

Requires **Python 3** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3 installer and not the Python 2 installer.
